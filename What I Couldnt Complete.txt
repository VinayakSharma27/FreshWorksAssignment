2. A new key-value pair can be added to the data store using the Create operation. The key
is always a string - capped at 32chars. The value is always a JSON object - capped at
16KB.

3. If Create is invoked for an existing key, an appropriate error must be returned.

6. Every key supports setting a Time-To-Live property when it is created. This property is
optional. If provided, it will be evaluated as an integer defining the number of seconds
the key must be retained in the data store. Once the Time-To-Live for a key has expired,
the key will no longer be available for Read or Delete operations.

3. A client process is allowed to access the data store using multiple threads, if it desires to.
The data store must therefore be thread-safe.
